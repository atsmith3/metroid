# Metroid

This was a final project for the Universiy of Illinois Electrical and Computer Engineering departments Digital Systems Lab (ECE 385). We chose to recreate a version of the classic Metroid game for the Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. We used Verilog to draw the scene and C code targeting a Nios II embedded processor to control the sprites on screen. [Here is a video of the game in action.](http://youtube.com)
